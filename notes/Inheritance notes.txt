Inheritance notes
===========================
Note: never ever create sub class object directly. Insted follow below points.
-----
1.super class object/ref can store/hold all its sub class/implementation class objects
2.sub class object can not hold super class object or ref
3.super class ref objet can be used to access all the methods of super class. and common methods (overrriden methods/a method present in both super and sub class) of sub class 

4.super refe object can not access the individual methods (a method defined only in sub class not in super class) of the sub class


method override notes
==========================
1. override means defining same method signature of super class into sub class

  method overriding accessibility
  ----------------------------------
  1. if the super class method defined as public, then all its sub classes methods
     must override with 'public' access modifier only
  2. if the super method defined as 'default', then sub class overridden methods
     can be defined as 'default,protected and public'
  3. if the super class method defined as 'protected', then sub class overrriden 
     methods can be defined as 'protected and public'

  4. private,static and final methods can not be overridden in sub classes


  what is final?
  	-> if a variable defined as final, then its constant
  	-> if a method is defined as final, then it can not be overrriden in sub classes
  	-> if a class is defied as final, then that class can not sub classes

   A class in java can be defined only as public , final and abstract.
