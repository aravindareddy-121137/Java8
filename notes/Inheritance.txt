Inheritance
==================

 Types : 2 types
 -----------------
 1. single :  any sub class must have only one super class
 			-> super class/base class/parent class
 			-> sub class/derrived class/child class

 2. multiple : any sub class can have more than 1 super classes


-> re-usability : objects and methods
-> polymorphism : method overridding
-> abstractions => storing sub class object in super class ref
